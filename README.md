# FILM-FINDER
Created a movie suggestion or options webpage using web api - TMDB.

This is my first api based project, in which I used tmdb api to get:

Movie genre -> Choose category which movie you want to watch.
Get all Movies of Genre and then we will show any random movie from that, but show only one at a time.
Then getting full movie info from tmdb using movie id.
We have also added movie POSTER and DESCRIPTION so that we get to know kind of movie before start watching.

At last we can like or dislike recommendation,
On every like or dislike recommended movie changes to some other movie of same genre.

I deeply searched in tmdb documentation note which keywords must be used in api endpoints and for various other major syntaxes also.
Documentation provided by tmdb was very helpful for me to know which type of requests required for various responses.
Majorly converted all responses to json format and then used it.

Used various CSS properties to display movie view -> Movie Poster + Movie Description.
Used badic Html to make structure of webPage.
